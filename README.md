# Debate-God

Assume you are a 8th grade student with a bit of tough luck in critical thinking and civic engagement skills.

Teachers don’t have nearly enough time to help every student with their practice work. That’s where our project comes into play. Our project helps to evaluate how effective an argument (for eg. debate) is based on the semantics and the context of the same.

You have your teachers, you have your assignments, homeworks, classworks and sessions. But that’s not nearly enough to get better at something new now is it? That right there seems to be a problem to me that hasn’t found a proper solution yet.

What you need is practice. Is it not? Well if you know that’s what you need then where is the problem in following through? One thing that does cross mind is who will check your work.
